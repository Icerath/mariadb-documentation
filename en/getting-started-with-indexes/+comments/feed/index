So each key value identifies only one record, but not each record needs to be represented."&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That implies that a unique index on a nullable column would need a table scan to do a WHERE c IS NULL query. I think it was meant to say that a UNIQUE index can include a nullable column, to for example allow UNIQUE indexes on (firstname, lastname) (where firstname is not nullable, and lastname is nullable) also work for rows that have a NULL lastname. Then also include the example that ('john',NULL) is not unique, so can occur many times.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Furthermore, I consider that (almost) all occurrences of 'record' and 'field' should be replaced by 'row' and 'column'.&lt;/p&gt;

"There are four main kinds of indexes; primary keys, unique indexes, plain indexes and full-text indexes." -- but only "Primary keys" and "unique indexes" are documented. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no documentation (or section header) for "plain indexes" or "full-text indexes". &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is minimal documentation for "Multi-column Indexes", but this type of index is not mentioned in the introduction.&lt;/p&gt;

See above, ie... "It will always identify only one record, and each record must be represented" and "So each key value indentifies (sic) only one record, but not each record needs to be represented."

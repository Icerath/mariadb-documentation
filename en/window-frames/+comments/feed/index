&lt;pre class="fixed"&gt;SELECT
       AVG(x) OVER(ORDER BY date RANGE BETWEEN 4 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW)  AS MovingAvg,
       SUM(x) OVER(ORDER BY date RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS CumulativeTotal
FROM t;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;That assumes that `x` is some numeric thing you are interested in, and the table needs to be sorted by `date` for computing a "Moving Average" and a "Cumulative Total".&lt;/p&gt;

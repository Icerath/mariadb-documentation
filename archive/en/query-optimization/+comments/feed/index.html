We tested the &lt;a href="/kb/en/mariadb-11-1-2-release-notes/"&gt;MariaDB 11.1.2&lt;/a&gt; aswell of course, but it got few things right and many things wrong.
MariaDB 11 is very good at many simple queries, even better than previous versions, but it is i dare to say aboslutely terrible at some more complex queries - worse than earlier MariaDB versions. MyIsam and Aria seem to be somewhat ok, but the performance/query plans are worse with InnoDB, compared ot older versions.
Of course we would prefer to stay with a single database, MariaDB to be precise, but if things are not going to change, we will be forced to use anything else for some of our databases - where both PostgreSQL or MySQL seem to have what we need, but we are also willing to go with SQL server or other paid options - We need things to work, the cost is secondary, and MariaDB cannot perform even if it got a whole server reserved for a single SQL statement.
As bad query plans take multiple times of execution time, it doesn't matter how much more optimized MariaDB is - as long as it cannot use the correct plan, it simply becomes the worst database.
Personally i think the changes to optimizer in MariaDB in the last 5 years have been a waste of time for professional environment, while Oracle got things already figured out and PostgreSQL got community large enought to plug the holes with Oracle-style optimizer hints.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I agree that it would be good for MariaDB to have more optimizer hints.
We will have a &lt;a href="/kb/en/what-is-mariadb-113/"&gt;MariaDB 11.3&lt;/a&gt; planning sessions in early September 2023 and I will ensure this is discussed then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That said, it would of course be better if the optimizer would get most things right from the start so that one would not have to specify any hints at all (as hints normally only applies for very specific WHERE conditions).
This is why we developed the new optimizer in 11.0 that is more capable in finding better plans than earlier MariaDB versions.

&lt;p&gt;Please try it out and tell us about your experience!&lt;/p&gt;
